# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe! 
(or Noughts and Crosses if you prefer!)

Hours (or more likely _minutes_) of fun...

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Built with

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript inc. jQuery

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Introduction

This was my first solo project for the General Assembly Sofware Engineering Immersive bootcamp.  I learnt how to organise a project from scratch, turn game logic into code (using an OOP approach) and have some fun with styling. 

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Gameplay / features

Click the button at the bottom of the screen to start the game.

The object of the game is to place your markers so they form a row, column or diagonal across the board (and to prevent your opponent from doing so).

The turn indicator to the left of the board changes colour to indicate each player's turn. Player 1 starts the game.

The scoreboard to the right of the board displays the win count across multiple games (a match). Each match is the best of 5 games. The player that is currently winning the match is marked in bold.

After each game is complete, the message button at the bottom of the screen appears to display the winner. Click the button to start the next game.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Customization:

Customization settings are found in the footer at the bottom of the window.

The *grid size* can be changed by selecting a number between 1 and 10 and clicking the 'Reset Game' button. Warning - all match progress will be lost.

The *player's marker* can be changed by entering up to 3 characters/symbols (or an emoji) into the input box at the bottom of the window. The marker change will take effect from the start of the next game.

## Easter Egg:

See if you can find the hidden Easter Egg to turn the game into Angel v Devil mode.
